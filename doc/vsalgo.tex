\secrel{Algorithms vs AlgoGraphs}

\noindent
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm}{Algorithm} is a description of a
\emph{principally sequential process} of doing computations, control, or any
process in general.

\medskip\noindent
\term{AlgoGraph} are is \emph{in principle non-sequential}\note{if you do not
do a special effort on \term{synchronization}}, so it is a second feature to be
good for parallel software systems description and design.

\medskip\noindent
The most buzzword methodologies can be natively described in algographs and AG
itself has the ability to transform models, and especially useful to generate
program code to make designed models be directly used for computations and
production systems design.
