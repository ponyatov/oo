\clearpage\secrel{Map (key/value storage)}

\noindent Another container required for VM run is \term{map}: it holds data
identified by \term{key}s: every data element has unical id which can be used to
fetch it from container.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Map(Container): pass
def test_Map(): assert Map('map').attr == {}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
\F\ require map for storing definintions in \term{vocabulary} \ref{vocab}, so
map is the second root data structure in our system.
