\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
W = Map('FORTH')			# global vocabulary register

def test_FVM_W(): assert W.head() == '<map:FORTH>'
\end{lstlisting}

\emph{Word search in vocabulary} is one of prime in \F\ mechanics. And going to
objects we will use the same hint to dispatch messages. \F\ F don't use
vocabulary in the execution of compiled definition, as all cross-word links were
resolved in compilation stage, and Map implementation efficiency impacts only on
the speed of interpretation and compilation. In case of message dispatch in pure
dynamic object/actor model it is not so, so for real-world applications, we need
to do a large effort on making vocabulary search at a speed of light.

\bigskip
Returning to a prototype implementation, we need to add some syntax sugar to Map
code: let's redefine \verb|operator<<| as we will use it a lot for injecting VM
commands implemented in \py\ into the vocabulary.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Map(Container):
	def __lshift__(self,F): # operator<<
		try: self.attr[F.value] = F # push object
		except AttributeError: # fallback for 
			self.attr[F.__name__] = VM(F) # VM command
		return self # return modified Map
\end{lstlisting}
\clearpage\noindent
Then we can test VM command injection into new empty vocabulary, using test
function as VM command (any function can be used as command, if it follows  
\verb|def command(<nothing>)| template):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def test_Map_LL(): assert '%s' % \ # test tree out
	( Map('LL') << test_Map_LL ) == \
		'\n<map:LL>\n\ttest_Map_LL = <vm:test_Map_LL>'
\end{lstlisting}
