\clearpage\secrel{AlgoGraphs:\\Metamodeling in terms of Objects}\secdown

\noindent \term{AlgoGraph} (AG) is a main actor in our system. AG is a
\term{hypergraph} of \emph{interacting} objects (actors). Objects have
\emph{active nature}, so they can \emph{modify} AG itself.

\medskip\noindent
An interaction between objects does via \term{message passing}, which is
\emph{native to distributed systems} and have very good \term{scalability}.

\medskip\noindent
Elements of AG describes widely used elements of software systems, so our model
is mix of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model}{Actor Model},
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming}{Generic Programming}
and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering}{Model-driven
engineering} with adaptation for
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming}{Metaprogramming}.
