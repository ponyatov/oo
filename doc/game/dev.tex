Game Development is the best domain for programmer practice and testing new IT
technologies. We will not chase the trends, and focus only on old-style 2D
games\note{platformer, fighting,  top-view arcades,\ldots} you can see on retro
consoles and home computer emulators, and some custom GUI you can use for
strategies, management simulators\note{SimCity} or ordinary applications\note{as
sample of software for retro style deskboard computer see here \ref{deskboard}}.
