\noindent
Symbol corresponds to any entity we must name to \emph{id}entify it. Symbol can
name program and physical variables, modules, math functions,\ldots\ any
\term{ID}. For example in \F\ \emph{word name} by fact is a Symbol instance,
before it was \term{resolve}d into some value or executable definition via
\term{vocabulary}.

Symbols has its own algebra. For example we should get error on try to evaluate
$A+B$, because we can't say what it means if we don't \term{resolve} symbols and
say what $A$ and $B$ means. Please don't confuse a Symbol and a Variable:
Symbol's value is itself.
