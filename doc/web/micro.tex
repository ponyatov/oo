\secrel{microWeb platform}\label{uweb}

This is experimental platform emulates old hobby computers not only in look and
feel but in used resources too. Some sort of this can be
\href{http://rk86.ru/}{this site}, emulates old russian \emph{Radio-86RK} based
on i8080 clone or \href{http://jsspeccy.zxdemo.org}{ZX Spectrum}.

The core idea is to make multiuser infrastructure emulates\note{on mobiles
phones primarily} network of old style computers able to interconnect via
Internet. \emph{This is some sort of usability test} for my idea of producing
extra-cheap deskboard computers for developing countries and retrocomputer
fans. Playing with this platform we should check is it usable enough for
everyday use with hardware limitations like tiny RAM, and lowres 2D graphics.
The second goal is to show what the 80th home computer would look like if Forth
had not lost its chance to be a default ROM OS.
