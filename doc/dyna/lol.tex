\clearpage\secrel{lol.VM in \py\ (LLVM backend)}\label{llvmpy}

For taking the first impression of pure managed compilation let's play with
\py\ only and LLVM compiler framework. The full source code you can found in
\href{https://github.com/ponyatov/o/blob/master/lol.py}{lol.py}.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo apt install llvm
$ sudo pip install llvmlite
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
If you are not friendly with bare LLVM, you can use online translator 
\url{http://ellcc.org/demo/index.cgi}\ lets you convert C/\cpp\ code into
LLVM assembly. And also you will need some entry tutorial on LLVM class model
itself you can find in \cite{llvmcore}.
