\clearpage\secrel{Callable objects}

\F\ distincts two types of words: executable and \term{literals}. If you look
into source code of any F system implementation or disassemble \verb|INTERPRET|
word, you'll see some checking of every word name parsed. If a parsed word looks
like a number and was not found in vocabulary, it will be pushed onto data stack
as is. In another case, vocabulary lookup will be done and found \term{execution
token} will be executed. This token is a magic thing which \F\ treats as an
\emph{executable object}: in classical system it is \emph{some magic number
points to \term{word definition} and can be executed by} \verb|EXECUTE|
\emph{word}. Our system works universally with objects on data stack, so for
uniformity \emph{in o\F\ any object can be executed}.

\noindent
\verb|EXECUTE| command works very simple: pop object from data stack, and run
it's \verb|execute()| method.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def EXECUTE(): D.pop().execute()
W << EXECUTE
\end{lstlisting}

For generic objects like primitives there is one
way to execute: just put object back to data stack:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Object:
	def execute(self): D << self ; return self
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
In \py\ and some other languages we can define \verb|operator()| method which
let us run any object as a function call, but I found this feature very error
prone and gives a lot of glitches, so avoid it.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def test_callable_generic():
	D.flush() << Object('callable')	# push generic
	W['EXECUTE'].execute()					# execute it
	assert str(D) == \
		'\n<stack:DATA>\n\t<object:callable>'
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def test_callable_literals():
	D.flush()
	D << Integer(1234) ; W['EXECUTE'].execute()
	D << String('lit') ; W['EXECUTE'].execute()
	assert str(D) == \
		'\n<stack:DATA>\n\t<int:1234>\n\t<string:lit>'
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Active does nothing with data stack:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Active(Object):
	def __call__(self): return self
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent \emph{And finally the thing makes \F\ alive}: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class VM(Active):
	def __call__(self): self.fn()
\end{lstlisting}
