\F\ is the easiest language you can imagine not in usage but \emph{in
implementation}. Source code is just single words delimited by spaces, there is
no syntax by fact.

Interpreter
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item reads \term{input stream} word by word,
  \item search readed \term{word} in \term{vocabulary}, and
  \item \term{execute}s it or \term{compile}s if \textit{compiler state} enabled
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
That's all! Some words has special \term{IMMED} flag and executes in any states.
This lets you switch off compiler mode or do some tricks with forward source
code lookup.
