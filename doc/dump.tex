\secrel{Dumping}

Working with an o\F\ system you will be sitting for hours looking on objects and
its contents. Every few second working on a design you will \term{dump} some
objects to see what is going on, and here we will define basic functionality to
do it.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	# this convert function will be used by 'print'
	def __repr__(self): return self.dump()
	# return only <T:V> header string
	def head(self):
		return '<%s:%s>'%(self.type,self.value)
	# padding with N tabs for tree-like output
	def pad(self,N): return '\t'*N
\end{lstlisting}
\clearpage
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	# recursive tree-like dump of any object
	def dump(self,depth=0,prefix=''):
		# tabbed head()er with optional prefix
		S = '\n'+self.pad(depth) + prefix+self.head()
		# attr{}ibutes subtree
		for i in self.attr:
			S += self.attr[i].dump(depth+1,'%s = ' % i)
		# nest[]ed elements subtree
		for j in self.nest:
			S += i.dump(depth+1)
		return S
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
Resulting dump as good as can be used in full-featured IDE if you need only text
representation.
