\secrel{Metaprogramming (embedded \purec\ backend)}\secdown

\begin{framed}
\emph{Metaprogramming is} complex thing by design\ --- it is much simpler to
write \textit{single} program by hands, then \emph{write program that writes
program}.
\end{framed}

\noindent
Metaprogramming is cool technique if your job is making a lot of typical
applications shares common code parts. So if you can distinguish a lot of
template-like code in your sources, you need a language with metaprogramming
capabilities. And it is not about macro\ --- \emph{you must have full scripting
at compile time} and access to your program code in the source code,
intermediate program representation, compiler structures and control on
compiling process itself.

\begin{framed}\noindent
If you are limited by some corporate rules, meta can let you generate program
source in pure C using \emph{\py} (or anything else) as the \emph{macro
language}.
\end{framed}

\noindent
Here you will be faced with complexity problem: metaprogramming is complex by
design, and the only way to hide this complexity\ --- use libraries and OOP, and
be ready for unavoidable complexity when you start.

\clearpage\secrel{Hello meta}

You already know this beast\ \ref{Object}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Object():
	def __init__(self,V):
		self.value = V ; self.attr={} ; self.nest = []
	def __lshift__(self,V): return self.push(V)
	def push(self,o):
		self.nest.append(o) ; return self
	def __setitem__(self,K,V):
		self.attr[K] = V ; return self
	def __getitem__(self,K):
		return self.attr[K]
\end{lstlisting}
\clearpage\noindent
Dump object:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	def __repr__(self): return self.dump()
    def head(self,prefix=''):
        return '%s<%s:%s>'%(prefix,self.__class__.__name__.lower(),self.value)
    def pad(self,N): return '\n'+'\t'*N
    def dump(self,depth=0):
        S = self.pad(depth)+ self.head()
        for i in self.attr:
            S += self.pad(depth+1) + self.attr[i].head(prefix='%s = '%i)
        for j in self.nest:
            S += j.dump(depth+1)
        return S
\end{lstlisting}
And here we are interested in metaprogramming:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    def cpp(self): return '/* %s */'%self.head()
\end{lstlisting}
