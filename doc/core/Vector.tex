Vector is \emph{ordered container} has very important role in o\F: \emph{it
contains executable definitions} in form of \term{sequential programs}.
Classical machine code or bytecode compiled programs can be easily represented
in a model of ordered container: linear list of commands, and jumps by integer
indexes.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Vector(Container): pass

def test_Vector(): assert \
	( Vector('ordered') << 1 << 2 << 3 ).nest \
		== [1,2,3]
