class Primitive(Object): pass

\noindent
\emph{Primitive} is a single data element can be used on an ordinary computer in
hardware or machine code level, and it \emph{is elementary entity in
programming}. Due to a rich base Object class, we can use attributes and add
nested elements like \emph{measurement units} to primitives. But it is
untraditional, not available in other programming languages and thus can cause a
lot of problems in code \term{autogen}eration.
