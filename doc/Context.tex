\secrel{Context}

In computing, \term{context} refers to \emph{state of current computation}:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item
instruction pointer to current position in program
  \item
CPU registers including state/flag registers 
  \item
two registers points to
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item base of stack frame or pointer to dedicated stack
  \item top of stack
\end{enumerate} 
\end{itemize} 
\medskip
In high level languages we also have
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item the scope of name visibility (local variables, object methods)
  \item resources allocated for task/process or held inside an actor
\end{itemize}

\clearpage\noindent
\emph{In traditional \F\ the whole context is global}: there is no multitasking,
so we have only single instruction pointer, data/return stack, and
vocabulary\note{in case of multiple vocabularies combined into vocabulary tree,
word search order is shared between all words}.

Moving to multitasking or object/actor model we must entangle VM with context
switching and holding of multiple execution pointers, stacks and so on. The task
becomes especially complicated if we want to utilize hardware multitasking
features available in multicore systems and grid computers. Here we will be
faced with a real hell of context switching under syncronizations, locks and
signal races.
