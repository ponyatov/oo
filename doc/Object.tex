\secrel{base Object class}\label{Object}\secdown

The whole system built on top of \emph{universal base object}: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Object:
  def __init__(self,V):
    self.type = self.__class__.__name__.lower()
    self.value = V
    self.attr = {} ; self.nest = []
  def __repr__(self):
    return '<%s:%s>' % (self.type,self.value)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
As you can see in \cite{budd}\ \emph{any object} must have two elements:
\begin{description}%[nosep]
\item[type]\ points to class of object\\
what '11' means? is it integer, number, or string of two `1`s\,?\\
we can't detect this directly, so we require some \term{type tag}

What type should this tag have itself? By design, it should be a pointer to some
Class object used for current object creation. But if we need only \emph{a fixed
set of types pre-built into the system}, we can downsize it just to tiny integer
value, indicates type \cite{STFPGA}. As we implement bootstrap VM
\ref{bootstrapVM} in \py, we just use a pointer to the class, provided by \py
VM. Or you can use some sort of \verb|std::string| in \cpp\ implementation, if
you are targetted on simplicity and not efficiency.

\item[value]\ holds object value (in case of primitive object)
\end{description}
