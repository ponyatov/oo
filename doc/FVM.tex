\secrel{\F\ Virtual Machine}\label{FVM}\secdown

Classical \F\ has:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item \emph{CPU} commands without attributes, manipulates data on
  \item \emph{data stack}, which resides in
  \item \emph{main memory} with lot of call/ret commands use separate
  \item \emph{return stack}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As we move to pure object language, our virtual machine should implement message
passing between objects, and uses executable types \ref{Active}\ for program
representation in place of main memory. Another diff from classical \F\ --- you
can't use direct addressing, all storage access must be done via state messages.
Every object state including data stack and vocabulary must be isolated.
