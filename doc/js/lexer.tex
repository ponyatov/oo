\secrel{Command input parsing using Jison}\label{jslexer}

For input parsing we'll use \url{https://zaa.ch/jison/}:
\begin{quote}
Jison takes a context-free grammar as input and outputs a JavaScript file
capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can then use the
generated script to parse inputs\ldots\ in almost any syntax you want. If you’re
familiar with Bison or Yacc, or other clones, you’re almost ready to roll.
\end{quote}

\noindent Classical \F\ has extra simple syntax, but it becomes too complex to
read sources especially if you work in a team of developers. Using parser
generator we can adapt input syntax as we want, for example use infix syntax for
calculator.
