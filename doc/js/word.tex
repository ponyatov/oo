\clearpage\secrel{PAD input parsing (classical approach)}\label{jsword}\secdown

Here we will expore classical \F\ approach used for user input parsing. As \F\
syntax is extra simple, we can easily write WORD in a few lines of code able to
read and parse PAD contents.

\begin{lstlisting}
W.word = function word() {
	log.innerHTML += '\n' + pad.value + '\n'; }

window.onload = function entry () {
	log.onclick = W.word;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Clicking on LOG area you will get full text entered in PAD.
