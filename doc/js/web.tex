The Web is the topmost area in a commercial application development. JavaScript
is good as you always have it off-the-shelf in a browser preinstalled on your PC
or mobile device. And it becomes notable fast with V8 JIT and WebAssembly still
having dynamic nature, which is good for us. We have this options:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item run o\F\ backend using \py\ VM and have a user interface able
  to do full-featured GUI and CLI interface worldwide
  \item port VM to \js\ by hands, and run it local in browser
  \item generate application .js using metaprogramming
  \item mix any of them 
\end{itemize}
