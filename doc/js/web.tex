The Web is the topmost area in a commercial application development. JavaScript
is good as you always have it off-the-shelf in a browser preinstalled on your PC
or mobile device. And it becomes notable fast with V8 JIT and WebAssembly still
having dynamic nature, which is good for us. We have this options:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item run o\F\ backend using \py\ VM and have a user interface able
  to do full-featured GUI and CLI interface worldwide
  \item port VM to \js\ by hands, and run it local in browser
  \item generate application .js using metaprogramming
  \item mix any of them 
\end{itemize}
\pg Here we will create distributed object live system able to \emph{work
without server} living only in client browsers. It can be done if you have
multiple nodes in one subnetwork using WebSockets. In a real word, you have
slaughter firewall when your mobile operator provides you a connection, so some
message forwarding server is required. The same thing you can have at home, as
white IP is still has a price, buggy WiFi routers alive, or your ISP
administrator has curved hands on the back.
