\emph{Metaprogramming is} complex thing by design\ --- it is much simpler to
write \textit{single} program by hands, then \emph{write program that writes
program}.

\noindent
Metaprogramming is cool technique if your job is making a lot of typical
applications shares common code parts. So if you can distinguish a lot of
template-like code in your sources, you need a language with metaprogramming
capabilities. And it is not about macro\ --- \emph{you must have full scripting
at compile time} and access to your program code in the source code,
intermediate program representation, compiler structures and control on
compiling process itself.
