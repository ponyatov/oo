And now we have all classes required to build basic \F\ system.

\bigskip\noindent
\emph{We will not follow any standards of language}. Our goal is to do a long
jump from an assembly-like language for a dumb stack-based virtual machine
\ref{FVM}\ to metasystem optimized for modern challenges: distributed cluster
and cloud computers, production data systems, huge multiformat websites,
dynamic compilers for a lot of target platforms including embedded, IoT and
mobile devices (\emph{Android in the first place}). There are a huge amount of
experimental features, whilst \F\ standards emanate stinks of antique,
naphthalene and oblivion. But the core idea of language stays the same.
