\clearpage\secrel{Compiler}\label{ucompiler}

Compiler into bytecode was written as stand alone application in flex/bison. It
implements some sort of portable assembly: resulting code is extra compact
comparing to most known real machine code formats. The compiler has no ability
to execute code in compile time, so you can't use some tricks available in
any generic \F\ system.
