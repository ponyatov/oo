\begin{itemize}
  \item 
The software has growing complexity.
  \item 
Objects let decrease complexity.
  \item 
Modern programming languages targetted\\for \emph{execution efficiency},
but not for \textcolor{red}{programmer efficiency}.
  \item 
Computing moves to distributed systems, so we need general scalability paradigm
works over \emph{heterogeneous} computing networks build on \emph{detachable}
nodes. \textcolor{red}{Message passing is totally scalable}.
  \item 
Humans think in terms of objects, schemes, data flows and use cases.\note{and
not in Scheme}
\end{itemize}
